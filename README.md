This repository contains code for the project "DJ-EEG". The aim of this project is to make a BCI-based affective computing platform that is audio-based. More Specifically, the data acquisition is done non-invasively through EEG headsets. We specifically aim to make a platform that can adapt the feedback to the media through inference based on audio-elicited affective states.
